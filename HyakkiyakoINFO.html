        <body>Before the "百物语" game, the participants gathered in the same dark room. After each of them had finished a strange story to tell in turn, they had to leave their seats in the dark and go into the next room where the walking lamp was burning and blow out a wick. After the ninety-ninth strange talk, the last wick was left to continue burning. If it comes to the hundredth strange talk, Aoandon will appear.</body>
